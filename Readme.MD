# 1.What is Edit time analysis errors?

# 2.Discuss in detail about wildcard operator and it's useage

# 3.Pre increment and Post Increment example

```
b = ++a; // Increment a before b gets its value.
assert(a == b); // 1 == 1

a = 0;
b = a++; // Increment a after b gets its value.
assert(a != b); // 1 != 0

```

# Type assert operator

```
as , is , is!

type caseting -> (employee as Person).firstName = 'Kevin'
you only do this if object employee is a Person , if not then the expression throws TypeException

to check the type of a object use 'is'

if(employee is Person){
    employee.firstName = 'Kevin'
}

```

# explain and write a example program that uses cascading operator
